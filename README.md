# A simple flake based config for WSL

I'm currently using a windows computer. Since I can't possibly live without NixOS I've
created this simple config that has most things I need for daily life.

Interestingly enough, it comes with a template for `typst`, but does not come with `typst`.
Try to figure that one out why don't ya.
